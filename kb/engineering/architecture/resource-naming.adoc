= Resource Naming

[quote, Phil Karlton]
There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.


Consistent naming resources is critical in our daily work for collaboration and automation. This document is to help naming  our global wide resources.


== Complete Name

> `tld`.`example`.[`vendor`].[`env`].[`deployment`].`product`.[`component`].[`version`].[`sequence`]

The naming convention:

1. has simple rule: scope of the resource get smaller from left to right.
2. each naming section only allow `^[a-z][a-z0-9]+$` start with letter and only contains lower case letter or number
3. generate resource name based on the convention
